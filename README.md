# Implementation-of-Iterative-Policy-Evaluation-for-a-Finite-MDP
## Aim

To implement iterative policy evaluation using Gymnasium and estimate the state-value function $V^\pi(s)$ for a fixed random policy.

---
## Software Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install gymnasium numpy
```

---

## Environment Used

The experiment uses the **FrozenLake-v1** environment from Gymnasium.

FrozenLake is a grid-based reinforcement learning environment where the agent starts from a start state and tries to reach the goal state without falling into holes.

For the default 4 x 4 FrozenLake map:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Observation space | 16 discrete states |
| Action space | 4 discrete actions |
| Actions | 0 = Left, 1 = Down, 2 = Right, 3 = Up |
| Reward | +1 for reaching goal, 0 otherwise |
| Terminal states | Goal and holes |

---

## Problem Statement

Evaluate a fixed random policy in the FrozenLake-v1 environment.

The agent follows a random policy, where each of the four actions is selected with equal probability:

$$
\pi(a|s) = \frac{1}{4}
$$

This probability refers to the policy's action-selection probability. The environment transition probabilities are obtained from Gymnasium using `env.P[state][action]`. If `is_slippery=True`, the agent may not move in the intended direction due to stochastic transitions.

The objective is to estimate the state-value function:

$$
V^\pi(s)
$$

---

## Theory

The state-value function under policy $pi$, denoted by $V^\pi(s)$, represents the expected return starting from state $s$ and following policy $pi$.

The Bellman expectation equation is:

```math
V^\pi(s) =
\sum_a \pi(a|s)
\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a)
\left[
R(s,a,s') + \gamma V^\pi(s')
\right]
```

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $s$ | Current state |
| $a$ | Action |
| $s'$ | Next state |
| $\pi(a \mid s)$ | Probability of selecting action $a$ in state $s$ |
| $P(s' \mid s,a)$ | Transition probability |
| $R(s,a,s')$ | Reward |
| $\gamma$ | Discount factor |
| $V^\pi(s)$ | Value of state $s$ under policy $\pi$ |

---
## Algorithm

1. Create the FrozenLake-v1 environment using Gymnasium.
2. Access the transition model of the environment.
3. Initialize \(V(s)=0\) for all states.
4. Define a random policy where each action has equal probability.
5. For each state:
   - For each action:
     - Read transition probability, next state, reward, and terminal status.
     - Apply the Bellman expectation equation.
6. Repeat until the value function converges.
7. Display the final value function as a 4 x 4 grid.

policy = np.ones((n_states, n_actions)) / n_actions

# Initialize value function
